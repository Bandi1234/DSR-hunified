15. 	DISCLAIMER. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT BANDAI NAMCO AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE FOR ANY VIRUSES OR OTHER DISABLING FEATURES THAT AFFECT YOUR ACCESS TO OR USE OF THE GAME OR ANY INCOMPATIBILITY AMONG THE GAME, OTHER SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. THE GAME AND ALL OTHER SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” EXCEPT AS MIGHT BE DESCRIBED HEREIN, BANDAI NAMCO AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND (EXPRESS OR IMPLIED AND ARISING BY LAW OR OTHERWISE) INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied terms nor the exclusion or limitation of warranties or guarantees in contracts with consumers, so some or all of the disclaimers in this section may not apply to you.

If you are a resident of Australia, in addition to the above terms in this section, the following additional wording will apply to you:
This Section 15 does not intend to limit or reduce any mandatory or statutory consumers’ rights or remedies that apply under the laws of your local jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by law, the conditions and warranties implied by the Schedule 2 of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Australian Consumer Law) are entirely excluded from this Agreement, and to the extent that they may not be excluded, you acknowledge that the liability of BANDAI NAMCO is limited to, and acknowledge that, it is fair and reasonable so to limit BANDAI NAMCO’s liability to:
(i)	the supplying of the Game again; or
(ii)	the payment of the cost of having the Game supplied again.

If you are a resident of Germany, in addition to the above terms in this section, the following additional wording will apply to you:
To the extent any services are provided against a fee, the following applies: BANDAI NAMCO warrants that the Game will operate materially as specified in the applicable documentation or product description. In the event of any defect, BANDAI NAMCO will provide subsequent performance by either removing the defect (e.g. by providing a patch) or providing a new version of the service that does not have the defect, within a reasonable time period allowing for at least three attempts at subsequent performance. If subsequent performance definitely fails, you may exercise your other statutory rights, provided however that BANDAI NAMCO’s no-fault liability for initial defects under sec. 536a para 1. of the German Civil Code is excluded in any event.
