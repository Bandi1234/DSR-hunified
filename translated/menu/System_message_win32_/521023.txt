We may also obtain information from other sources as far as it is necessary to perform our Services, and combine that with information we collect through our Services. In all other cases we will ask you to authorize us to collect, store, and use personal information from third parties. For instance, we may collect game ranking and achievement status from your console or mobile operating system game center application. Additionally, when you complete in-app purchases, we may collect information about you from the provider of your device operating system when they process the purchases on our behalf. Please note that we do not receive your payment method information from the operating system providers.
