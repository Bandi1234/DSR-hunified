Head carved of archtrees by Gough in his
imprisonment. Gough imparts an emotion to
each and every completed carving, which
helps him achieve personal enlightenment.
When a head is disturbed, it speaks,
reflecting the emotion conferred to it.

This head says "Thank you". Have another
look. Is this not a face of gratitude?
