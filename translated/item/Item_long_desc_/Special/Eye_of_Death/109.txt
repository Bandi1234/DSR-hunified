Online play item.
Lure phantoms from other worlds.
(Only Covenanter can use the item while Hollows cannot)

The dreadful Eyes of Death spread disaster
across neighboring worlds. Phantoms lured
to the host world may end up as victims,
allowing the Eyes of Death to multiply,
and leading to further proliferation of bane.
