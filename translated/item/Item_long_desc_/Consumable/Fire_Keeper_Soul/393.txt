Soul of a long-lost Fire Keeper.

Each Fire Keeper is a corporeal manifestation
of her bonfire, and a draw for the humanity
which is offered to her. Her soul is gnawed
by infinite humanity, and can boost the power
of precious Estus Flasks.

It can be used to gain Humanity and restore HP
at the cost of losing the Fire Keeper soul to
reinforce the Estus Flasks.
