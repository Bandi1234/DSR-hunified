Stone imbued with the power of the dragons.
Rite of apostles of the ancient dragons.
Gain head of dragon. Emit dragon breath.

The dragon apostles seek transcendence of
life itself, attainable by transformation
into an ancient dragon. This rite is only one
step, but it cannot be reversed until death.
