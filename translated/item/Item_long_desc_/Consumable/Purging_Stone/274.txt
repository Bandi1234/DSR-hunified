Ash-colored stone encasing a skull.
Secret treasure of Arstor, the Earl of Carim.
Reduces curse build-up and breaks curse.

Humans are helpless against curses,
and can only redirect their influence.
The Purging Stone does not dispel curses,
but receives them as a surrogate. The stone
itself was once a person or some other being.
