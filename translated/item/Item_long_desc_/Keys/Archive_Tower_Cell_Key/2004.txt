Key to the cell of the Duke's Archive Tower.

The Archive Tower, once a trove of precious
tomes and letters, became a prison after the
onset of Seath's madness. The serpent men
who guard the prison know not the value of
what they hide. In the basement of the tower
are the writhing "mistakes" of the terrifying
experiments which were conducted there.
