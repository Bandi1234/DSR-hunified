This crest opens a door in the
Darkroot Garden sealed by ancient magic.

The door leads to the grave of Sir Artorias
the Abysswalker. Many adventurers have left
for the grave, but none have returned,
for they make easy prey for local bandits.
With such dangers, the crest can do more harm
than good in the hands of the uninitiated.
