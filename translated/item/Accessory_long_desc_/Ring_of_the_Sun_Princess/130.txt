This ring is granted to those who enter a
Covenant with Gwynevere, daughter of Lord Gwyn
and the Princess of Sunlight. This slightly
warm ring boosts the synergy of miracles.

The Princess of Sunlight Gwynevere left
Anor Londo along with many other deities,
and later became wife to Flame God Flann.
