Weapon type: Straight Sword
Attack type: Regular

The sword of the knights of the Four Kings of
New Londo. Its blade is wide and thick, and
it is wielded in an unusual manner.
When the Four Kings were seduced by evil,
their knights became Darkwraiths, servants
of the Dark who wielded these darkswords.
