Weapon type: Pyromancy Flame
Attack type: Strike

Pyromancy flame drawing upon the latent power
of Quelana of Izalith, mother of pyromancy.
For the pyromancer, a flame is a precious
thing indeed, to be nurtured, often for an
entire lifetime. When the flame is shared, it
creates an eternal bond between the parties.
