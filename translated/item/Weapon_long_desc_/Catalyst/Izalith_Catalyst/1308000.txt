Weapon type: Catalyst
Attack type: Strike

Catalyst of the Witch of Izalith of long ago,
when her daughters were still flame witches,
before they were engulfed by the Chaos Flame.
Before the birth of pyromancy, their wands
were mediums for sorcery, but knowledge of
this flame sorcery has long since vanished.
