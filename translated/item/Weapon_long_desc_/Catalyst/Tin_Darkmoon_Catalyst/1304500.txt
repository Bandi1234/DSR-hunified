Weapon type: Catalyst
Attack type: Strike

Catalyst born from the soul of the Dark Sun
Gwyndolin, Darkmoon deity who watches over
the abandoned city of Gods, Anor Londo.
Gwyndolin is Gwyn's lastborn and a legitimate
god, but he is also a Moon sorcerer, and this
wand is boosted by faith, not intelligence.
