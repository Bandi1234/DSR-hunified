Leggings of the Darkmoon Knightess,
Fire Keeper of Anor Londo.

After becoming Undead, she visited the Dark
Sun Gwyndolin at the Mausoleum of the Spiral
Depths, became a Blade of the Darkmoon,
and assumed the flame-keeping duty. She
received these leggings, which hide her
hideous form and help her hunt the guilty.
