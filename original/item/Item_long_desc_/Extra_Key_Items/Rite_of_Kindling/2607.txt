This secret rite allows bonfires to be
bolstered further with Kindling, so that
even more Estus can be collected.

Kindling was a sacred rite passed down
among clerics, but all Undead can imitate
the process, in the same manner that they
restore their Hollowing with humanity.
How peculiar that humans had found little
use for humanity until they turned Undead.
