Head carved of archtrees by Gough in his
imprisonment. Gough imparts an emotion to
each and every completed carving, which
helps him achieve personal enlightenment.
When a head is disturbed, it speaks,
reflecting the emotion conferred to it.

This head says "Help me!" Look again.
Can you hear the desperate plea?
