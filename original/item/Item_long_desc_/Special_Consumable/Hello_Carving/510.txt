Head carved of archtrees by Gough in his
imprisonment. Gough imparts an emotion to
each and every completed carving, which
helps him achieve personal enlightenment.
When a head is disturbed, it speaks,
reflecting the emotion conferred to it.

This head says "Hello". Have another look.
Do you sense the amicability in its eyes?
