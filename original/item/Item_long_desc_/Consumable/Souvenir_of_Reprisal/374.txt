Blood-drained, shrunken ear.
Souvenir taken for subduing the guilty.

The knights called the Blades of the Darkmoon
punish the guilt-soaked offenders of the Gods
and take this as proof of their conquest.
The earless corpses of the guilty will be
left behind as a warning to others, inspiring
both fear and respect for the Gods. Such is
the eternal mandate of the Dark Sun.
