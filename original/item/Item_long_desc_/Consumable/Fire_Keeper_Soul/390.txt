Soul of the Ash Maiden,
Fire Keeper of Firelink Shrine.

A Fire Keeper's soul is a draw for humanity,
and held within their bosoms, below just a
thin layer of skin, are swarms of humanity
that writhe and squirm.
Was the Ash Maiden locked in this dark prison
for some transgression, or by her own will?
