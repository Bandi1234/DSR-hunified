Warm pebble emitting a beautiful phasing aura
of seven colors, with a very rare eighth.

The rainbow stone does nothing special, but
can serve as a path marker, and can be
dropped off a cliff to judge height by the
sound of its descent.
If a loud noise is heard upon its landing,
then a fall off the ledge is surely lethal.
