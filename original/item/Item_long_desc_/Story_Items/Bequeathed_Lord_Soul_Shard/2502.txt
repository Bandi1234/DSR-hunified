Soul of one of the Four Kings, who fell to
Dark. A fragment of a Lord Soul discovered
at the dawn of the Age of Fire.

Lord Gwyn recognized the foresight of these
four great leaders of New Londo, and granted
them their ranks and the fragments of a
great soul. Although this is not a full Lord
Soul, it can still satiate the Lordvessel.
