Soul of the Bed of Chaos and the mother
of all demons. This Lord Soul was found
at the dawn of the Age of Fire.

The Witch of Izalith attempted to duplicate
the First Flame from a soul, but instead
created a distorted being of chaos and fire.
Its power formed a bed of life which would
become the source of all demons, and is more
than enough to satiate the Lordvessel.
