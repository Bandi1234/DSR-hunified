Weapon type: Greatsword
Attack type: Regular

This sword, one of the rare dragon weapons,
came from the tail of Seath the Scaleless,
the pale white dragon who betrayed his own.
Seath is the grandfather of sorcery, and this
sword is imbued with his magic, which shall
be unleashed as a wave of moonlight.
