Weapon type: Catalyst
Attack type: Strike

A sorcery catalyst born from the soul of
Manus, Father of the Abyss.
A rough, old wooden catalyst large enough
to be used as a strike weapon.
Similar to the Tin Crystallization Catalyst,
it boosts the strength of sorceries,
but limits the number of castings.
