The head of an Oolacile resident whose
humanity went wild after being devoured
by the Dark of Manus, Father of the Abyss.

The bloated head is fissured, the cracks
lined with innumerable tiny red eyeballs,
and accented by protruding brain parts.
It is lightly enchanted, suggesting that it
may have belonged to a sorcerer.
