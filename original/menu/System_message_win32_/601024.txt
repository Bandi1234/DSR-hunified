18. 	DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
THIS SECTION 18 APPLIES TO YOU ONLY IF YOU RESIDE IN NORTH, CENTRAL, AND SOUTH AMERICA, OTHER THAN THE UNITED STATES.

If you are a resident of any nation of the Americas, other than the United States of America, either you or BNEA may refer any dispute relating to or arising from this Agreement or the Game to alternative dispute resolution (such as conciliation or arbitration) with the prior written consent of the other party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the terms of this Agreement will not prevent you from bringing any dispute or claim that may be subject to this Section 18: (i) to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from BNEA on your behalf; (ii) bringing against BNEA, in any court of competent jurisdiction, any claim that is not arbitrable or for which arbitration is prohibited or restricted by applicable law; or (iii) from bringing any claim before a small claims court, subject to the jurisdictional limitations and requirements of such small claims court.
