13. 	COPYRIGHT POLICY. Copyright owners or agents of copyright owners who believe that anything in the Game infringes upon any copyright owned or controlled by them, may submit a notification of such infringement with our designated Copyright Agent as set forth below. The processing of your notification can be expedited by providing the information and declarations set out in 17 U.S.C. §512(c)(3). Compliance with this statute is not a prerequisite for infringement notification except for copyright owners located in the United States. Any person who knowingly misrepresents in a notification that the material or activity is infringing, may be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by us or the alleged infringer as the result of our relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the accused material or activity. BANDAI NAMCO has adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at BANDAI NAMCO’s sole discretion, users who are repeat infringers of the intellectual property rights of third parties. Provided however that, BANDAI NAMCO also may limit or terminate access to the Game of any users who infringe any intellectual property rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
